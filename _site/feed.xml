   The purpose of this blog is for sharing my experience on the &lt;a href=&quot;https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5194121086500864&quot;&gt;GSOC2018&lt;/a&gt; program and all the progress and obstacles that will eventually come up along the road. There will be a lot of learning, headbanging, facepalming and, hopefully, victories during this project.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Accompany me on this journey.&lt;/p&gt;
