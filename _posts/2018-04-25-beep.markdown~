   11 years after my first post on a defunct and forgotten blog, here I am posting again.
   The purpose of this blog is for sharing my experience on the [GSOC2018](https://summerofcode.withgoogle.com/projects/#5194121086500864) program and all the progress and obstacles that will eventually come up along the road. There will be a lot of learning, headbanging, facepalming and, hopefully, victories during this project.

   Accompany me on this journey.

   See you later,

   Davide
